**Project Name**: Add 2 Numbers - Endpoint
<br/>
**Description**: In this webapi mini-challenge, design an API endpoint where you ask user's to enter two numbers. Once the user inputs two numbers, the api should output and print the results in a sentence.
<br/>
**Peer**: Thao Vang
<br/>
**Review**: The api works fine. I would just recommend instead of a math operation, write it out as a sentence.
